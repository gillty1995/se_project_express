**Intro**

This project was created to set up an api server for the "WTWR" app. The server will function to store the users data, as well as any clothing items uploaded to the users collection.

**Technologies**

The server is set up using _Express_, _MongoDB_, and _Mongoose_. _ESLint_ was used to integrate neccessary extensions. _Postman_ and _Github Actions_ were used to test the api server responses and endpoints.

**Techniques**

_Routing_: I organized my routes using Express, and connected the appropriate models to their controllers.

_Middleware_: I used middleware to parse JSON request bodies.

_Error Handling_: I used constants to define my error codes to keep my code dry.

_Database Connection_: I established a connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose and handled connection success and errors.

_API Testing_: Using postman and to test the api endpoints.

_Automated Testing_: I used automated testing by using github actions.

_Data Management_: I used Mongoose Compass to create and manage data within my database.

**Final Thoughts**

The server adheres to RESTful requirements and will function to store the users data from the "WTWR" website.
